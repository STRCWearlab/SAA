<div class="row mt-3"><h4>STUDY TITLE</h4></div>
Smart Annotation Assistance User Study

<div class="row mt-3"><h4>INVITATION PARAGRAPH</h4></div>
You are being invited to take part in a research study. Before you decide whether or not to take part, it is
important for you to understand why the research is being done and what it will involve. Please take time to
read the following information carefully.

<div class="row mt-3"><h4>WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY?</h4></div>
The aim of the study is to evaluate the potential of AI assistance in user interfaces, particularly annotation tools for time-series data.

<div class="row mt-3"><h4>WHY HAVE I BEEN INVITED TO PARTICIPATE?</h4></div>
We are looking for computer literate individuals aged 18+. Experience with activity recognition and sensor signals is desired but optional.

<div class="row mt-3"><h4>DO I HAVE TO TAKE PART?</h4></div>
It is up to you to decide whether or not to take part. If you do decide to take part you will be given this
information sheet to keep and be asked to sign a consent form. If you decide to take part you are still free to
withdraw at any time and without giving a reason.

<div class="row mt-3"><h4>WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO ME IF I TAKE PART?</h4></div>
You will be provided instructional material to explain how to annotate human activities based on
accelerometer sensor signals. You will then perform an annotation task on a computer both with and
without AI assistance. After both tasks you will be asked to fill out a questionnaire about your experience.

<div class="row mt-3"><h4>WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE DISADVANTAGES AND RISKS OF TAKING PART?</h4></div>
Participating in the study will take up to two hours of your time. It involves mainly screen work, which might
cause visual fatigue and eye strain.

<div class="row mt-3"><h4>WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE BENEFITS OF TAKING PART?</h4></div>
You will be compensated for your time with a Â£20 Amazon voucher.

<div class="row mt-3"><h4>WILL MY INFORMATION IN THIS STUDY BE KEPT CONFIDENTIAL?</h4></div>

you.

<div class="row mt-3"><h4>WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THE RESULTS OF THE RESEARCH STUDY?</h4></div>
The results of this research may be written into scientific reports for publication in academic venues. Your
anonymity will be ensured in the way described before. If you are interested in copies of the published
research, you can contact any researcher involved in the project.
